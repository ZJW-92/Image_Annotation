# Data Management 
In this exercise, you will check the consistency of annotations for a selected image. You are provided with one image and for this image there are a number of different judgements (a single judgement is one persons opinion about what the annotation should look like).  

For the image you have a corresponding .json file that contains all of the judgements for said image. In turn, each judgement corresponds to a list of objects, where each object contains a number of different keys that inform you about the object-class, position of the extreme points (top, right, left, bottom) and so on. 

## Tasks 
### Task 1 Draw all boxes from one single annotator onto one image


### Task 2 Draw all boxes avalibale for the same image onto the image



### Task 3 Draw all boxes from two annotators onto an image. 




### Task 4 Compute the IOU between the annotations of the two annotators
